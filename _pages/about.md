# DeltaRCM

DeltaRCM is an organization of people who use, develop, and maintain the DeltaRCM ecosystem.

There are several versions of DeltaRCM floating around the web, and a central goal of this project is to reduce the number of different model branches, while maintaining flexibility for development by any users.



## Overview of DeltaRCM models

pyDeltaRCM is the Python version of the Matlab deltaRCM model by Man Liang. 
This model was turned into a component for WMT, the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) Web Modeling Interface by Mariela Perignon and Mark Piper in \~2016.

Since then, the project has been organized here, and has continued to grow with new projects and contributors.
