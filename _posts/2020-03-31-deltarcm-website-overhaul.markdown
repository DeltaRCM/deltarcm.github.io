  The DeltaRCM website gets an overhaul.
---


This project is beginning to come on-line, and with that, we needed a new website. 
Our website now runs on GitHub Pages, and is built with Jekyll.

The site is built using the [jekyll-theme-open-project](https://github.com/riboseinc/jekyll-theme-open-project) theme, generously provided by Ribose Inc.
Huge thanks to the developers there for making this awesome theme open source.

Watch out for more changes coming soon!
