The DeltaMetrics project is rebranding as sandplover and will become a part of the [sandpiper-toolchain](https://sandpiper-toolchain.github.io)  project. 

The complete transition is likely to take time, and has begun by transferring the GitHub project repository to the new [sandpiper-toolchain GitHub organization](https://github.com/sandpiper-toolchain). If you are a user or developer of the tool, please update your references and bookmarks accordingly. Over the coming months, we will transition the package name as used in the documentation and software itself to sandplover.
